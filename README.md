## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fabiola, a Master of Management Analytics candidate at the Rotman School of Management. I did my Bachelor in Statistics and Commerce at the University of British Columbia. My goal is to bridge business challenges with technology, leveraging advanced statistical expertise and technical skills to generate actionable insights and drive execution. I have gained valuable experience in Equity Research and Actuarial roles, with extensive technical expertise in financial analysis, risk assessment, data modeling, predictive analytics, and machine learning. 

My github is used for projects related in Machine Learning.
A brief overview of my public repositories
1. Software-Programming: Creating an application from scratch. Tools: Python (numpy, pandas, tkinter for gui), SQL
1. Case-Competition: Solving a business problem to identifying features to help customer retention and provide recommended business solution. Tools: Python (RandomForest, Lasso Regression, Logistic Regression, Feature Engineering, Neural Network)
2. Case-Competition-DataFest: Solving a business problem to help student learn better for an online textbook platform. Analyze chapter difficulties and provide recommendation for the platform to improve student learning experience. Tools: R (Clustering, Logistic Regression)
3. Student-Performance-Project: Identifying key features that impact student final grates. Tools: R (Regression, Model Selection, AIC)
4. Hospital-Project: Research based project of a comparative study between two alternative medication/solution for pediatric patient pain management. Tools: R (T-test, linear regression)

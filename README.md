# Hi, I'm Fabiola ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master of Management Analytics candidate at the Rotman School of Management, with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Statistics and Commerce from the University of British Columbia. My passion lies in leveraging advanced analytics and technology to solve business challenges and drive execution. I have gained valuable experience in Equity Research and Actuarial roles, with extensive technical expertise in financial analysis, risk assessment, data modelling, predictive analytics, and machine learning.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Expertise
Programming Languages: Python (Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib), R (Caret, glmnet, RandomForest, XGBoost), SQL, PowerBI, Excel 

Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning:
   
      - Regression: Linear regression, Lasso and Ridge regression
      - Classification: KNN, SVM, Logistic regression
      
2. Unsupervised Learning: 
      - Clustering (k-means, hierarchical clustering) 
      
3. Dimension Reduction: PCA and kPCA
    
4. Ensemble Methods: Random Forest, Bagging, and Boosting
    
5. Deep Learning/Neural Network
   

## ðŸ’¼ Projects Overview

I use this GitHub to share my projects related to Machine Learning and Data Science. Below are some of my key public repositories:

**1. Software-Programming**

Created a software application (dating application) from scratch until GUI development. *Tools: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Tkinter for GUI), SQL*

**2. Case-Competition**

Developed a solution for a business case competition by identifying key features to improve customer retention and provide strategic recommendations. *Tools: Python (Random Forest, Lasso Regression, Logistic Regression, Feature Engineering, Neural Network)*

**3. Case-Competition-DataFest**

Analyzed student performance for an online textbook platform to help improve student learning experiences. The project involved analyzing chapter difficulties and providing recommendations for platform improvements. *Tools: R (Clustering, Logistic Regression)*

**4. Student-Performance-Project**

Investigated key factors affecting student final grades and developed models to predict student performance. *Tools: R (Regression, Model Selection, AIC)*

**5. Hospital-Project**
Conducted research on pediatric pain management, comparing two alternative treatments for their effectiveness. *Tools: R (T-test, Linear Regression)*


## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Currently Learning
